We go with digital communication as it is is more reliable than analog communiation. when we have noise in the system it is easier to decode a bit 0 or 1 rather than decode the whole spectrum of signals that are present while having a signal. It is similar to how analog signal will have all the details of a painting and when scaled down becomes harder to understand whereas digital comms is just distinguishing between black and white.

We need sampling as real signals are continous and have value for all infinite time intervals and its not possible for computers to compute all the intervals of time that is needed, so we follow nyquist sample theorem to ensure that there are enough samples to recreate the signals using a dac ( fs >= 2*fm ).

This is a simple program to show a cos signal being generated using a signal source and being captured using a time sink. we can see that the signal is being sampled at 32k which means that at every 1/32k time interval we take a sample which is shown below
